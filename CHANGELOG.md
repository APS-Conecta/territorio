# Changelog

All notable changes to Territorio are recorded here. Decisions behind them live in
[`docs/adr/`](docs/adr/).

## [0.1.0] — unreleased

First slice: the app shell and the map. No territorial data yet.

### Added

- Nextcloud 34 app that appears in the navigation and opens to a full-height Leaflet map.
- Administrator setting for the tile URL and attribution, so a clinic without internet access can
  repoint the basemap at a self-hosted tile server with no code change (ADR-0004).
- The Content-Security-Policy image host is derived from the configured tile URL, so the policy
  cannot drift from the tiles it exists to allow. Leaflet's `{s}` subdomain placeholder becomes a
  CSP wildcard; ports are preserved.
- A tile URL that is not a usable template is stored as typed — so the administrator can see and
  correct it — but never served, and never reaches the response header.
