"""Drive the running app the way a person would, and say what actually happened.

    make instance-up && make build && python3 tools/browser-check.py

This exists because nothing else in the repo touches the app. Three suites, a
webpack build and a two-axis review on every slice all passed for eight slices
while `Guardar` did nothing at all: `native-type` is the @nextcloud/vue 8 prop
name, so under 9 the button stayed a `type="button"` and never submitted its
form. No unit test loads a component, and webpack emits whatever it is given.

So this checks the two things only a browser can: that a Place typed into the
form reaches the database, and that a Sector drawn on the map does. It asserts
on the Registry, not on the DOM — a green screen with an empty table is exactly
the failure this is here to catch.

Runs headless against the throwaway dev instance (compose.dev.yaml, loopback
only, admin/dev). Screenshots land in tools/.browser-check/ for a human to look
at afterwards.

ponytail: one script, no framework, no page objects. It grows a function per
slice that has a screen; when that stops fitting, it wants a real suite.
